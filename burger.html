        <h4>Description:</h4>
        <p1>A burger is a sandwich consisting of one or more cooked patties of ground meat, usually beef, placed inside a sliced bread roll or bun. The patty may be pan-fried, grilled, smoked or flame broiled. Burgers are often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, or chiles; condiments such as mustard, mayonnaise, ketchup, relish, or special sauces; and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns. Burgers are commonly served with french fries, onion rings, potato chips, salad, or coleslaw as side dishes.</p1>
