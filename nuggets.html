        <h1>Description:</h1>
        <p1>Chicken nuggets are small pieces of chicken that have been breaded or battered and then deep-fried or baked. They are a popular fast food item and are often served with dipping sauces such as ketchup, honey mustard, or barbecue sauce. Chicken nuggets can be made from various parts of the chicken, including breast meat, thigh meat, or a combination of both. They are typically seasoned with salt, pepper, and other spices before being coated in breadcrumbs or batter.</p1>
